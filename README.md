# Music In Play  

**Music In Play** is a project I created during the autumn semester of 2024 for [PV259](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2024/PV259) as my final assignment. It’s a personal exploration of music and visuals — bringing the songs that inspire me to life through code.  

By analyzing a track’s frequencies, rhythm, and energy, I generate visuals that try to capture its essence. Each song gets its own unique image, a kind of digital painting shaped by the sound itself. It’s my way of translating music into something you can see, blending sound and visuals into a single experience. 

For me, this project isn’t just about coding — it’s about feeling the music differently.
